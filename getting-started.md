IBM introduces a new release of Direct Link Dedicated, now supporting VPC resources&mdash;the first of our "next generation" Direct Link offerings. Currently, this "limited availability" release only services certain Multi Zone Regions (Frankfurt, London, Dallas and Washington, D.C.  markets) with more locations being rolled out soon.

Highlights include:

* Metered billing, which lowers the barrier of entry to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
* Support for connections to multiple {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} accounts from a single direct link
* Support for multiple VPCs (without classic access) from a single Direct Link within the same account
* Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) address to create native connectivity between your on-premises environment and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}


Capabilities coming soon:

* Support for Virtual Private Endpoints (VPEs) from customer on-premises from a single customer account
* Support for a Direct Link connection to venues, such as Blockchain, SAP on Power, and more
* Support for a Direct Link connection to Public services; for example, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage (ICOS)
